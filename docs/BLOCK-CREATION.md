# How to Write a Webpack Block

This guide is going to show you how to create a custom webpack block. Don't worry, it's not hard!

Skip the _Hooks_ section if you are in a hurry. You can create a lot of cool stuff without using
them.

Read the _Basics_. You can come back and read more if you are stuck or wondering why it works this
way.

## Basics

A webpack block is _just a function_ that returns an update function and _requires no dependencies
at all_. The update function takes a webpack configuration object and returns an updated version of
this webpack configuration.

Take the `babel` webpack block for instance:

```js
/**
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {RegExp|Function|string}  [options.exclude]   Directories to exclude.
 * @return {Function}
 */
function babel(options = { cacheDirectory: true }) {
  return (context, util) => prevConfig => ({
    ...prevConfig,
    module: {
      ...prevConfig.module,
      rules: prevConfig.module.rules.concat([
        Object.assign(
          {
            // we use a `MIME type => RegExp` abstraction here in order to have consistent regexs
            // setting `test` & `exclude` defaults here, in case there is no `context.match` data
            test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: [{ loader: 'babel-loader', options }]
          },
          context.match // carries `test`, `exclude` & `include` as set by `match()`
        )
      ])
    }
  })
}
```

Thus it is also pretty easy to unit test and generic enough to share it with the world.

## Block utilities

You might have recognized the second paramter `util` in the last example's block function. It is an
object containing some convenience functions to make common tasks easier.

#### util.addLoader(loaderDefinition: object)

Returns an update function that adds the given loader definition to a webpack configuration. Use it
like this:

```js
function sampleBlock() {
  return (context, { addLoader }) =>
    addLoader(
      Object.assign(
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
        },
        context.match
      )
    )
}
```

#### util.addPlugin(plugin: WebpackPlugin)

Returns an update function that adds the given plugin instance to a webpack configuration. Use it
like this:

```js
function sampleBlock() {
  return (context, { addPlugin }) => {
    return addPlugin(new webpack.DefinePlugin({ DEBUG: 'true' }))
  }
}
```

#### util.merge(configSnippet: object)

Returns an update function that merges the given configuration snippet into a webpack configuration.
Use it like this:

```js
function sampleBlock() {
  return (context, { merge }) =>
    merge({
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['ts']
      }
    })
}
```

## Context

The context object is a metadata object that is passed to every block. It is meant to contain any
kind of data that is needed for webpack config creation, but not part of the webpack config itself.

Initially it will contain a `webpack` instance. If you are using [hooks](#hooks) you might want to
put custom metadata into the context and use it in the `post` hook.

### context.match

This is where the file matching patterns reside you set by using `match()` in the configuration.

If the block is used within a `match()` then `context.match` will contain:

- `test`: Which files to match, usually a regex or an array of regexs. Always present.
- `exclude`: Condition(s) which paths not to match. Might not be present.
- `include`: Condition(s) to override `exclude`. Might not be present.

If the block is not used within a `match()` then `context.match` will be undefined.

### context.webpack

The `context.webpack` property is the webpack instance, so you do not have to `require('webpack')`
in your blocks.

## Hooks

Sometimes the simple _a block is a function_ approach is not enough. Let's take the following
example:

You want to define constants using the `webpack.DefinePlugin`. The DefinePlugin will run over your
source files, look for occurences of the constants you defined and replace them by the value you
set.

Sounds good. But wait... What if multiple blocks want to define constants using the DefinePlugin
independently? You can write a tiny block `defineConstants` which takes the constants and creates a
webpack snippet containing a configured DefinePlugin.

The problem is that using this block multiple times will result in multiple instances of the
DefinePlugin! This is not what we want. We would like to define constants multiple times, store them
somewhere and eventually add a single DefinePlugin instance for all those constants to the webpack
config. _And this is where the hooks enter the stage._

### So what is it?

Every block may have one or multiple `pre` hooks and one or multiple `post` hooks. You can set them
like that:

```js
function myBlock() {
  const blockFunction = (context, config) => ({
    /* webpack config snippet */
  })

  return Object.assign(blockFunction, {
    pre: preHook,
    post: postHook
  })
}

function preHook(context) {
  // Manipulate the `context` here (register a new file type, for example)
}

function postHook(context, util) {
  return config => config // Return your update function here
}
```

Both `pre` and `post` hooks are optional and can either be a function or an array of functions.

Let's solve our constants definition example. We can now make the `blockFunction` store the
constants in the `context` and make the `postHook` instantiate the DefinePlugin:

```js
function defineConstants(constants) {
  return Object.assign(
    context => {
      context.defineConstants = Object.assign({}, context.defineConstants, constants)
      return config => config // Don't change the config here yet
    },
    { post }
  )
}

function post(context, { addPlugin }) {
  return addPlugin(new webpack.DefinePlugin(context.defineConstants))
}
```

`createConfig()` will _deduplicate all hooks_, so our post hook is run once only and we end up
having exactly one DefinePlugin instance containing all constant definitions.

In case you wonder, the `return Object.assign(blockFunction, { pre, post })` syntax is just
syntactic sugar and semantically the same as
`blockFunction.pre = pre; blockFunction.post = post; return blockFunction`.

### Lifecycle

So this is what happens under the hood when `createConfig()` processes the blocks:

- Run `pre` hooks (of all blocks)
- Run the actual block logic (of all blocks) and merge the config snippets
- Run `post` hooks (of all blocks) and merge the config snippets

That's it. The resulting merged config object is createConfig's return value.

### Best practices and pitfalls

#### Static pre/post functions

`createConfig()` filters duplicate hooks, so you can call a block multiple times, but each of its
hooks is only run once.

To make the deduplication work you have to make sure your hook functions are declared as static
top-level functions as shown in the example. _Do not declare the hook functions inside your block
function_, since this would mean that those hook functions are re-created on every call of the block
and cannot be deduplicated.

#### Use the context for metadata

If you have got metadata that you need in a later lifecycle stage, but that is not part of the
actual webpack config object then please store it in the `context` object.

That is what the context is for and making that metadata part of the webpack snippet you return is
really bad practice, especially since webpack 2 is going to validate the webpack config against a
fixed schema.

## Testing

You definitely want to test your blocks, so you don't ship broken stuff, right?

Have a look at the [testing docs](./TESTING.md).

## Publishing

So you have written your first webpack block. Now what to do with it?

1.  Write a small README
2.  Add a `package.json` (add dependencies here, like loaders/plugins your block configures)
3.  Open a pull request on webpack-blocks or `yarn publish` your block

If you aren't sure whether your block should become part of the official webpack-blocks repository
feel free to just open an issue and ask us!

Have fun.
