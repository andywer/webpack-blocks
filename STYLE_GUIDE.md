# webpack-blocks style guide

## Names

* *webpack-blocks*, always in lower-case letters, even at the beginning of a sentence.
* Do not use *webpack blocks* to refer to the project.
* Use `webpack-blocks` (in backticks) to refer to the `webpack-blocks` package.
* Use *webpack block* or just *block* to refer to a particular block, like `babel` or `postcss`.
* Write block names in backticks: `typescript`, `uglify`.
* Write *webpack* lower-case letters, unless it starts a sentence.

## Casing

* Use sentence casing everywhere, even in titles.
