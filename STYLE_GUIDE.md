# webpack-blocks style guide

## Names

- _webpack-blocks_, always in lower-case letters, even at the beginning of a sentence.
- Do not use _webpack blocks_ to refer to the project.
- Use `webpack-blocks` (in backticks) to refer to the `webpack-blocks` package.
- Use _webpack block_ or just _block_ to refer to a particular block, like `babel` or `postcss`.
- Write block names in backticks: `typescript`, `uglify`.
- Write _webpack_ lower-case letters, unless it starts a sentence.

## Casing

- Use sentence casing everywhere, even in titles.
