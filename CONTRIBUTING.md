# How to Contribute

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository, then run

```bash
yarn install
```

Run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Code

This repository is a monorepo which means it contains multiple NPM packages. We use
[Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) architecture to install dependencies and
link local packages between each other, and [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to run
commands for one or more packages from the root directory.

Running `yarn install` in the repository's root directory will install the dependencies of all
packages and link the packages that depend on each other.

Running `yarn test` will run all packages' tests. Run `yarn test` inside a package directory to test
this package only.

Just edit the code like you always do. Be aware that we automatically lint and format code with
[eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
