# webpack-blocks - the convenience package

This is the webpack-blocks convenience package. It wraps all the most commonly used blocks, so you
can install just this single package and have webpack-blocks and your favorite blocks set up.

## Usage

Here is a small sample configuration. Instead of requiring from `@webpack-blocks/webpack`,
`@webpack-blocks/babel` and others you just need a single `require()` and a single dependency in
your `package.json`.

Of course you can still separately define or install custom blocks and use them as you want.

```js
const webpack = require('webpack')
const {
  babel,
  createConfig,
  css,
  defineConstants,
  entryPoint,
  env,
  extractText,
  match,
  setOutput,
  uglify,
  postcss
} = require('webpack-blocks')
const cssnano = require('cssnano')

module.exports = createConfig([
  entryPoint('./src/main.js'),
  setOutput('./build/bundle.js'),
  babel(),
  defineConstants({
    'process.env.NODE_ENV': process.env.NODE_ENV
  }),
  match('*.css', { exclude: /node_modules/ }, [
    css(),
    env('production', [
      extractText(),
      postcss({
        plugins: [cssnano()]
      })
    ])
  ]),
  env('production', [uglify()])
])
```
