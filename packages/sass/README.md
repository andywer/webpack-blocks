# webpack blocks - SASS

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@webpack-blocks/sass.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webpack-blocks/sass)

This is the `sass` block providing SASS/SCSS support for webpack. Uses `node-sass` via `sass-loader`.


## Usage

```js
const { createConfig } = require('@webpack-blocks/webpack')
const sass = require('@webpack-blocks/sass')

module.exports = createConfig([
  sass(/* node-sass options */)
])
```

## Options

You can pass random `sass-loader` options as an object to the `sass` block. Those options are basically identical with [node-sass' options](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#options).
